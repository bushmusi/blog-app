# Blog App

The Blog app is a classic example of a blog website. I have created a fully functional website that will show the list of posts and empower readers to interact with them by adding comments and liking posts.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
`ruby 3.0.4`

* System dependencies
- Node
- Ruby
- Rails
- Git

* Configuration
- **Run app**
  - ``rails server``

* Database creation
  - ``create database blog_app``

* How to run the test suite
  - Ruby linter test: ``rubocop``
  - Style linter test: ``npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"``
